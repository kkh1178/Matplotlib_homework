### You've since been given access to the fictional Pyber's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. 

### Create charts (pie, scatter, etc) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

# Results:

#### Visualization of the total number of rides per city, color coded by the type of area and bubble size based on number of drivers
